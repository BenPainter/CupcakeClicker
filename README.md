# Overview

The goal of the project was to learn how to make Android studio and so I thought what better way to learn than to make a simple game? The purpose of this app was to build the framework for a tycoon game that is similar to Cookie Clicker and Egg Inc. The gameplay loop is mostly just clicking a button and buying things to click for you so you can proceed to then buy more things. It’s a simple premise that can stack, forming a much longer game. I have designed it in a way so that adding new buttons for more items to buy is as simple as adding just a few lines of code and a new variable for that button.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Android Studio for the program and I used Kotlin as the main language. Nearly all the libraries I used for this project were the default ones that are included in Android Studio. I did add an additional one to help keep track of time so the values on the screen could be refreshed at a predetermined interval.

# Future Work

* Add more graphics to the UI. It was a part of the original plan, but the images I was using would not scale correctly. It would be nice to add those images back in.
* Move the shop to a 2nd page. There will be a tab on the top left side for the shop and once the player presses it, it will display all the buttons for buying new items.
* Add more upgrades. There is only an upgrade for the player’s taps. I can add upgrades for the other objects as well so they are more valuable and useful later on in the game.
